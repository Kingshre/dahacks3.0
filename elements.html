									<h2>Exoplanets</h2>
									<p>An exoplanet is a planet that orbits a star outside our solar system, found in diverse forms:
                   Types: Gas giants, rocky planets, and icy worlds.
                   Discovery: Detected via transit (dips in starlight) or radial velocity (star wobbles).
                   Proximity: Some exoplanets are just a few light-years away.

									</p>
									<hr/>
									<h3>Habitable Planets</h3>
									<p>Habitable planets are those exoplanets that have conditions that can support life. Key factors include:
										Liquid Water: Essential for life, must be present.
										Habitable Zone: Located where temperatures allow liquid water.
										Atmosphere: Contains gases like oxygen and nitrogen for life processes.
										Stable Climate: Long-term stability is crucial for sustaining life.
										Magnetic Field: Protects from harmful solar radiation.
										</p>
									<hr />
									<h2>Why Search for Exoplanets in the Habitable Zone?
									</h2>
									<p> 1. Earth-Like Conditions 
										   These planets are more likely to have temperate climates and atmospheric conditions that could support complex life forms, making them prime targets for studying potential habitability. <br>
										2. Discovering Extraterrestrial Life
										Finding an exoplanet with the right conditions could be the key to detecting signs of life beyond Earth, expanding our understanding of the universe. <br>
										3. Future Exploration and Colonization 
										Habitable zone exoplanets could become potential destinations for future space missions, possibly even for human colonization.
										</p>
									<h3>Exciting Exoplanet Discoveries
									</h3>
									<p><b>Proxima Centauri b </b>
										Location: Orbits Proxima Centauri, the closest star to our Sun.<br>
Habitable Zone: Positioned in the star's habitable zone, making it a promising candidate for supporting liquid water and potential life. <br>
Distance: Relatively close to Earth, enhancing its significance for future exploration. <br>
<b>TRAPPIST-1 System</b> <br>
Overview: A star system featuring seven Earth-sized planets, with at least three in the habitable zone.
Significance: The systemâ€™s proximity and the potential for temperate conditions make it an ideal target for studying exoplanetary atmospheres and habitability.



									</b></p>
									<h4><b> Parameters for Determining a Habitable Planet</b> </h4>
									<p>
										To assess whether a planet could support life, scientists consider several key factors: 
										1. Orbital Location 
										The planet should be in the habitable zone of its star, where temperatures allow for liquid water.
										It must orbit a star outside our solar system to qualify as an exoplanet. 
										2. Mass and Size 
										Must be smaller than 13 Jupiter masses to avoid being classified as a brown dwarf.
										Can range from rocky Earth-like worlds to large gas giants, but must remain within planetary mass limits. <br>
										3. Composition and Structure
										Planets are typically composed of rock, metal, gas, or ice.
										Their classification (e.g., terrestrial, gas giant, ice giant) depends on size and distance from the star.<br>
										4. Stable Orbit and Star Interaction
										The planet should have a stable orbit around its star.
										Rogue planets (not orbiting a star) are rare but can still be considered under certain criteria.

								<h1>Distribution of Exoplanet Types</h1>
								<p>This chart represents the distribution of different types of exoplanets discovered so far, including Neptune-like, Super Earth, Gas Giant, Terrestrial, and Unknown types. The data suggests that Neptune-like and Super Earth types are among the most commonly observed, whereas terrestrial and unknown types are much rarer.</p>

								<p><h3>Space Waste Management </h3>
									Space Debris and Collisions <br>

The growing problem of space debris poses significant risks to satellites and space missions: <br>

1,500 debris-generating events have occurred since the start of the space age, increasing the amount of junk in orbit. <br>

A 2009 collision between an Iridium satellite and a defunct Russian satellite created over 2,000 debris pieces, showing the dangers of crowded orbits. <br>

The ISS regularly performs collision avoidance maneuvers, using valuable fuel and resources to stay safe.<br>

Efforts like the NASA Orbital Debris Program are crucial to managing these risks and protecting space assets.
